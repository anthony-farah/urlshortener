# URL Shortener

1. Creating this URL shortener I used XAMPP, mysql and PHP. 
2. To run this url shortener you will need to move urlshortener.php and style.css to htdocs in your XAMPP folder. 
3. Create a database with a user and use the sql in dburl.sql. You will then need to connect your database to php by entering in your database name in urlshortener.php. 
4. Create a new folder called .htaccess with the code printed and save in your htdocs folder.
